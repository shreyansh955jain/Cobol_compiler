Yes, it is possible to call a procedure (PROC) from a REXX program inside a loop. You can use the ADDRESS command in REXX to execute a procedure. Here's a basic example of how you might do this:

rexx


/* Your REXX program */
do i = 1 to 10
  /* Call your PROC inside the loop */
  ADDRESS TSO "SUBMIT 'your.proc.name'"

  /* Optionally, you can check the return code of the PROC */
  if SQLCODE <> 0 then
    say "PROC failed for some reason"
  else
    say "PROC executed successfully"
end




JCL and Stored Procedures

What is store procedure in JCL

ChatGPT
In the context of JCL (Job Control Language), there is no such thing as a "store procedure." JCL is primarily used for defining and managing batch job execution on mainframe systems.

However, if you are referring to stored procedures in the context of a database system, then that's a different concept. Stored procedures are precompiled and stored in a database for later execution. They contain a set of SQL statements and are typically used to encapsulate complex database operations.

If you have a specific question or need more information about JCL or stored procedures in a different context, please provide more details so I can assist you further.

DSNACCOX Store Procedure 

ChatGPT
It appears you're referring to a specific stored procedure called "DSNACCOX" in the context of IBM Db2 or another mainframe database system. This might be a custom or system-defined stored procedure used for various database management tasks.

Without more context or information about your specific use case, it's challenging to provide detailed information about this particular stored procedure. Typically, stored procedures are created to perform specific actions or tasks within a database system.

If you have a specific question or need assistance with using the "DSNACCOX" stored procedure or understanding its purpose, it's recommended to consult the documentation of your database system or contact your database administrator for more details.

How can I find that file containing record or not in JCL

ChatGPT
In JCL (Job Control Language), you can check whether a file contains records or not using conditional processing. You can use the IF statement in your JCL to conditionally execute steps based on whether a file is empty or not.

Here's a basic example of how you can do this:

jcl
Copy code
//CHECKFILE JOB ...
//STEP1   EXEC PGM=IEBGENER
//SYSPRINT DD  SYSOUT=A
//SYSIN    DD  DUMMY
//SYSUT1   DD  DSN=your.input.file,DISP=SHR  <-- Input file
//SYSUT2   DD  DSN=&&TEMPFILE,DISP=(NEW,PASS),SPACE=(CYL,(1,1))
//STEP2   EXEC PGM=IDCAMS
//SYSIN    DD  *
  REPRO - 
    INFILE(SYSUT2) -    <-- Check if the temporary file has records
    OUTFILE(SYSOUT) -   <-- Output the result
/*
//STEP3   EXEC PGM=YOUR_PROGRAM
//INPUT    DD  DSN=&&TEMPFILE,DISP=SHR
//...
Here's a breakdown of the steps:

In STEP1, you use the IEBGENER utility to copy the input file (your.input.file) to a temporary file (&&TEMPFILE).

In STEP2, you use the IDCAMS utility to check if the temporary file (SYSUT2) has records. If it does, it will produce output indicating that the file is not empty.

In STEP3, you can execute your program or take further actions based on the result from STEP2. You can use a conditional statement like COND=(0,NE) to check the return code from STEP2 and decide whether to proceed with your processing or not.

This JCL example will help you determine whether a file contains records or not and take appropriate actions based on that condition. You can customize it further to suit your specific requirements.

Is it possible to call the proc using rexx program inside a loop

ChatGPT
Yes, it is possible to call a procedure (PROC) from a REXX program inside a loop. You can use the ADDRESS command in REXX to execute a procedure. Here's a basic example of how you might do this:

rexx
Copy code
/* Your REXX program */
do i = 1 to 10
  /* Call your PROC inside the loop */
  ADDRESS TSO "SUBMIT 'your.proc.name'"

  /* Optionally, you can check the return code of the PROC */
  if SQLCODE <> 0 then
    say "PROC failed for some reason"
  else
    say "PROC executed successfully"
end
In this example:

The REXX program contains a loop that runs 10 times.

Inside the loop, the ADDRESS TSO command is used to execute the PROC named 'your.proc.name'. You should replace 'your.proc.name' with the actual name of your procedure.

Optionally, you can check the return code (SQLCODE) to see if the PROC executed successfully or encountered any issues.

This allows you to call a procedure multiple times from within a REXX program, typically in a loop or based on certain conditions, as needed for your specific requirements.
